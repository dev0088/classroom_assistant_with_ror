### MacOS

Building for MacOS requires an [Apple Developer ID certificate](https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/).
Once obtained and installed on your machine, reference the identity as the
`CLASSROOM_DESKTOP_OSX_DEVELOPER_ID` environment variable. This can be done by
adding the following line to your `.bashrc`:

```
export CLASSROOM_DESKTOP_OSX_DEVELOPER_ID=<your developer identity>
```

You can retrieve a list of developer identities available in your keychain by running:

```
security find-identity -p codesigning
```
